# My Shout App
An app built using Vue JS 2 and Ionic 5.

Its primarily built for the purpose of deploying to android app store.

However a PWA version of the app is also deployed at www.myshout.ie.


## Technical Elements
The app is a Vue app built using the Vue CLI and then the Ionic 5 packages added to it. The reason it is not built using the Ionic CLI is because at the time of creation (August 2020) the Vue version of Ionic was still in Beta. A fully fledged Ionic Vue release is due soon - once Vue 3 is released.

The app using tabs to navigate between pages.

### Also uses:
Vuex for state management,
Vuelidate for for input validation,
Firebase for the database persistance,
Axios for communicating with Firebase via REST API.
